# We Eat Children - A Placeholder Website Template

Welcome to the wild and wacky world of "We Eat Children," a placeholder website template that's as absurd as it sounds. This project is a tongue-in-cheek demonstration of what a charity website might look like if it were designed by someone who had a few too many cups of coffee and a penchant for dark humor.

## About This Project

"We Eat Children" is a fictional charity organization that, thankfully, does not actually exist. This website template is a playful exercise in web design, showcasing a variety of sections, animations, and interactive elements that you might find on a real charity website. However, please note that this is purely for entertainment and educational purposes. No children were harmed, eaten, or even considered during the making of this template. Feel free to check out our main project [here](https://github.com/KHROTU/Bloxd-Forge), and try it out for yourself.
